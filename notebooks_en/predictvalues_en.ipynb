    "# Predict values from regression analysis using the regression equation\n",
    "\n",
    "When we do [regression analysis](regression1_en.html) we estimate how independent variables are related to a dependent variable. In this guide we will cover how to calculate expected values, guesses, for which value on the dependent variable a specific observation should have.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful both for illustrating the results of the regression analysis, or for comparison with reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will show: \n",
    "1. What the regression equation is\n",
    "2. How to get the values we need for the equation\n",
    "3. How to calculate guesses (predicted values) with the equation\n",
    "4. What the error term (residual) is\n",
    "5. How to calculate guesses for each observation of the dataset\n",
    "6. And finally how to see that the guesses calculated by hand are the same as the ones we calculate automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The regression equation\n",
    "In order to make a guess we need to have a regression equation. The equation shows how to calculate an expected value for the dependent variable, based on the observation's values on the independent variables. The table Stata produces after the regression analysis shows the different parameters of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally the regression equation is shown in the following way (here with two independent variables):\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_i = \\alpha+ \\beta_1X_{1i} + \\beta_2X_{2i} + \\epsilon_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "The different part denotes the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Symbol | Meaning |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|\n",
    "| $y_i$    | Value of the dependent variable for person $i$ |\n",
    "| $\\alpha$    | Intercept/constant (shown in the regression table) |\n",
    "| $\\beta_{1}$    | Coefficient for the first independent variable (shown in the regression table) |\n",
    "| $X_{1_i}$    | Value of the first independent variable for person $i$ |\n",
    "| $\\beta_{2}$    | Coefficient for the second independent variable (shown in the regression table) |\n",
    "| $X_{2_i}$    | Value of the second independent variable for person $i$ |\n",
    "| $\\epsilon_i$    | The error term for person $i$, that is, the difference between the actual value of the dependent variable ($y_i$) and our guess. |\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the general form. **We will, for each observation, make a guess as to what the value of dependent value should be, by multiplying the values on the independent variables with their respective coefficients.**\n",
    "\n",
    "But in each analysis we do we can switch the greek letters for actual numbers. Let's say we want to analyze the incomes of people. We hypothesize that income depend on education and gender. We then run an analysis with two independent variables: the level of education attained, and whether one is a man or woman. The equation would then look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$income_i = \\alpha+ \\beta_1education_i + \\beta_2sex_i + \\epsilon_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know a person's level of education and gender we can make an informed guess of their income. But then we need to know which numbers to put in the place of $\\alpha$, $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$, that is, the intercept, and the coefficients for education and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we guess we don't include an error term in the equation. It is only there to make the equation match the true income. When we make a guess our equation instead looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$guessedincome_i = \\alpha+ \\beta_1education_i + \\beta_2sex_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get the values to the equation using regression analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We get the numbers when we do a regression analysis. In the american General Social Survey there questions about all variables we are interested in: income (\"realrinc\"), level of education (\"degree\", a five-degree scale that runs from 0 no education to 4 master degree) and gender (\"sex\", where man is 1 och woman 2). Below we run a regression analysis with income as dependent variable and education and gender as independents."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Predicted values are often interesting in order to make a more concrete connection between our model and substantial issues. It might, for example, be more pedagogial to showh how highly educated people are expected to differ from people with no school, rather than to say \"the coefficient for educatinon is 8139\". Sometimes it is also interesting to compare our guess with reality to say which observations that are (so to say) over-performers and under-performers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation can be expanded as needed, dependning on the number of variables we have. In this example we only had two variables, education and sex. If we for instance would add age the equation would be slightly longer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$iincome_i = \\alpha+ \\beta_1eduation_i + \\beta_2sex_i +  \\beta_3age_i + \\epsilon_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of a regression analysis is, to summarize, to try to estimate what the best values of $\\alpha$, $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$ and $\\beta_3$ might be, and this is (among other things) whas is showed in the regression table after a regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the equation can also be used to make guesses where we don't have the correct answers. For instance, it is easy to make a model that shows how results in presidential elections are affected by economic growth, the popularity of the president, and more. We then of course use historical data when we construct the model. But then we can add current data into the equation, and get an informed guess about what will happen after the next election. The procedure is just the same."
