    "\n",
    "Panel data can be structured in two ways: \"long\" or \"wide\". To take an example, let's say we have data on countries, over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wide data\n",
    "With wide data each row in the dataset stands for one country, and each column a variable at one point in time. For instance the population size of a country, a certain year. Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| country | population2000  | population2001  | population2002  |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| Sweden  | 8872284         | 8888675         | 8911899         |\n",
    "| Norway  | 4491572         | 4514907         | 4537240         |\n",
    "\n",
    "It might seem intuitive at first glance, and it makes it easy to compare certain years to each other. But it is harder to do more advanced analyses, with many different variables (population, GDP, unemployment, and so on) we will need a lot of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long data\n",
    "In general it is more convenient to have the data in long form. In long data each row represents one country one year, and each column represents one variable. But we also need a variable that shows which year the row represents. The table above would look like this in long form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| country | year     | population      |\n",
    "|---------|----------|-----------------|\n",

    "| Norway  | 2002     | 4537240         |\n",
    "\n",
    "The same data, in another format. Here we instead have few columns, but a lot of rows, but rows are easier to work with in Stata. To change format from wide to long, or from long to wide, use the command `reshape`. There will be another guide about that. The rest of the guide presumes that the data is in long form."
