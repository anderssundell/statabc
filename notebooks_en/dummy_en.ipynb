    "Regression analysis requires that the independent variables are interval scales, that is, that the distances between the steps of the scale are equally long. Since the analysis basically consists of drawing a straight line over the different values of the independent variable, the interpretation will be very strange if there is no consistency over the steps. Even more so if there is no ordering of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables that (untransformed) are not suitable as independent variables are for instance party affiliation, place of birth or personality type. These are categories, with no clear ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a solution: *dummy variables*. A variable that only has two values has equal distance between all the steps of the scale (since there is only one distance), and it can therefore be used in regression analysis. By dividing up categorical variables in multiple such dummy variables, where each variable represents one variable on the original variable, we can analyze the categorical variable in a regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this is like comparing mean values across the groups. The advantage is that we in a regression analysis also can control for other variables. In this guide we will walk through what dummy variables are, how to create them in Stata, and how to include them in a regression analysis."

    "## What dummy variables are\n",
    "\n",
    "Dummy variables are variables that divide a categorical variable into all its values, minus one. One value is always left out in a regression analysis, as a reference category. B-coefficients for the new variables will then show the expected differences in relation to the reference category. If we start with a variable that has five values, we will have to create four dummy variables. If we start with a variable with three values, we will have to create two dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dummy variables have the value 0 or 1: If the unit of analysis has the value in question it gets a 1, otherwise a 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we want to investigate the possible effect of a country's electoral system on the number of parties represented in parliament. Classical theory in political science says that countries with majoritarian electoral systems (where the party that gets the most votes in a district takes all the seats from that district for instance) will have fewer parties, whereas countries with more proportional electoral systems (where seats are distributed proportionally to the share of votes) will have more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the QoG dataset there is a variable for electoral system, `gol_est`. It has three values: `Majoritarian`, `Proportional` and `Mixed`. You could perhaps argue that the mixed category is a sort of middle value between majoritarian and proportional, but we cannot really be certain. A safer strategy is to treat the variable as having three distinct categories. We then need to create two dummy variables to be able to analyze the variable in a good way. They are created according to the followin principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Original value | dum_proportional | dum_mixed |\n",
    "|----------------|------------------|-----------|\n",
    "| Majoritarian   | 0                | 0         |\n",
    "| Proportional   | 1                | 0         |\n",
    "| Mixed          | 0                | 1         |\n",
    "\n",
    "The majoritarian category is here the reference, and gets a zero on both the two new variables. Proportional systems get a 1 on the variable `dum_proportional` and mixed gets a 1 on `dum_mixed`. The coefficients for `dum_proportional` and `dum_mixed` will thus show the difference between the two categories and the majoritarian category. If we want to see the difference between proportional and mixed in the coefficients, we would have to leave one of them out, as the reference category."

    "Dummy variables are necessary to be able to use categorical variables (especially ones that lack rank ordering) in a regression analysis. It is not necessary to give each value a dummy variable of its own - we can also choose a specific set of values, that are compared to the rest. It is however important to remember what the comparison we make actually consists of. All values that don't have their own variable conssitute the reference category, and the dummy variables show the differences compared to the reference category."
