    "\n",
    "The first value we enter determines the type of variable. If it is a number the variable becomes a numeric, and if it is a piece of text the variable turns into a \"string variable\", a text variable. We cannot mix numbers and text. If we do, the variable must be a string variable, and the numbers will be treated like any other text, and cannot be analyzed statistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each observation - what we're comparing - should have its own row in the dataset.** If it's countries, each country should have its own row. If it's persons, each person should have its own row, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each variable gets its own column.** In the QoG dataset, which I use in a lot of examples, the observations are countries, and the variables are country characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "New variables are automatically named \"var1\", \"var2\" and so on. If we want to change the name, for instance to \"population\", we can rename the variable with the `rename` command, usually abbreviated `ren`. We then write the command, the old name of the variable, and then the new name:"

    "A common situation when working with data is that we have data somewhere, but not in Stata format. Often it is in Excel or .csv format.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is in Excel format I usually create an empty dataset (either by restarting Stata or by writing the command `clear`) and paste all the data into the data editor. We can usually get the variable names as well, if there are any in the Excel document. Sometimes, however, there are some problems with the names, and Stata turns all variables into text. If that happens, select everything but the names in Excel, and paste all the values into the data editor. Then rename the variables one by one with the help of the `rename` command.\n",

    "However, when the dataset is large the copy and paste function might cause some problems. Then it might be better to save the Excel data in a .csv format.
