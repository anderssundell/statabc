    "One of the simplest methods for investigating relationships are *crosstabs*. The upside is that they are easy to do and fairly easy to understand. The downside is that is cumbersome (but not impossible) to account for more than two variables. If we want to do that we are better off using regression analysis. But crosstabs might be useful for a quick overview of a relationship.\n",

    "We will in this example use the <a href=\"https://qog.pol.gu.se/data/datadownloads/qogbasicdata\" target=_blank>QoG basic dataset</a>. I have here entered the web path to the dataset directly, but you can of course download it to your computer and load it from there."

    "## A simple crosstab\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look closer at the relationship between a country's level of democracy and its electoral system - more specifically whether the country has proportional representation (PR) or not. PR means that seats in the parliament are distributed in proportion to the vote shares of the parties, like in Sweden. In contrast, representatives to the American congress are elected in single-member districts, where the person that gets the most votes wins. Among other things, this means that a party that gets somewhat more votes still can get a big majority in parliament. Some research also suggests that PR would be better for democracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crosstab cannot prove cause or effect, but we can at least see whether countries that have PR also are more democratic, or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our indicator of democracy we will use `fh_status`, that shows how free a country is, according to the american organization Freedom House. To measure PR we use the vairable `dpi_pr` from Database of Political Institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command we use is called `tabulate`, usually abbreviated `tab`. We first write the command, then the variable we want in the rows, and then the variable we want in the columns. I generally prefer to have the independent variable in the rows."

In the same way, it would be strange to say that Chinese people are richer than Swedes just because there are more billionaires in China - they are many more to begin with.

    "Each cell's share of the column total, 71, 51 and 39, is the *column percentage.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember the meaning of calculating the percentages in different directions. In the table above, if we take the row percentage we get the share of PR countries that are free, and the share of non-PR countries that are Free. If we instead calculate the column percentage we get the share of Free countries that have PR, and the share of non-PR countries that have PR, and so on. **This is not the same thing!** To draw conclusions about the possible effect of PR, we need to calculate row percentages in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "My principle is that I always put the independent variable - the variable I think is the cause - in the rows, and then I always calculate the row percentage, to get the most sensible results. But you can of course do as you find easiest to undersetand.\n",

In the column Free we now see that we have 76% in the PR row, and only 24% in the non-PR row. But this **does not prove** that it is three times as common for countries to be free if they have PR. It only shows that many more countries have PR, overall. If we want to say something about the likelihood of being free, depending on whether the country has PR or not, we need to look at the row percentage.\n",

Continuous scales - like a country's GDP or a person's age - leads to tables with hundreds of cells, impossible to overlook. In those cases it is better to display the results graphically, or to calculate averages in different groups."
