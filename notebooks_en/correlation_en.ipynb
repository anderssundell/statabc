    "One of the simplest but still most informative analyses you can do on a statistical material is the correlation analysis. It shows the direction and strength of a relationship between two variables. With direction, we mean whether it is positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is positive, more of one variable is associated with more of the other. Conversely, less of one variable is associated with less of the other. If the relationship instead is negative, more of one variable will be associated with less of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different measures of correlation, that are tailored to variables of different types. The most common is <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient\" target=_blank>Pearson's R</a>, which shows the linear relationship between two interval scal variables. It runs from -1 (perfect negative relationship) via 0 (no relationship) to +1 (perfect positive relationship).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the <a href=\"https://qog.pol.gu.se/data/datadownloads/qogbasicdata\" target=_blank>QoG basic dataset</a>. If you want to follow, download it and put it in your project folder. Then open it with the `use` command. Remember to specify the path correctly."

    "Correlation analysis is a very useful tool to explore our data, and quickly get an overview of what the relationships look like. A correlation matrix is often a good feature of a thesis' method section, or in the beginning of the results section, as it makes it easier for the reader to understand what's going on in the more advanced analyses. Regression analysis also builds on the correlations between the included variables.\n",
    "\n",

The matrix is just a condensed form of presentation: the calculations only take into account two variables at a time."
