Not a lot, but neither is one dollar.\n",

The coefficient shows that if we increase the logarithmic variable with one step, life expectancy will increase with 5.082 years. But what does this _mean_? To reinterpret it in more concrete terms, we can divide the coefficient by 100, so that it is 0.05082. __This represents the increase in life expectancy, if we increase GDP per capita with one percent, compared to what it was previously.__\n",

Or if we want to be evan more exact, with one tenth of a percent, 1000 times. In practice, this means that we need to increase it so that it is 2.71828 times as large as it was before. Do you recognize the number? It is the number $e$, which is the base for the natural logarithm we used to construct the variable."
