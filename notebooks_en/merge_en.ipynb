    "Many statistical analyses requires the that we comvbine several datasets. We might get information about the independent variable from one source, and want to analyze the effects of it on a dependent variable from another source. We thus have the same observations in both datasets, but want to combine the variables. We do this with the command `merge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another scenario is when we have different datasets with the same variables, but with different units of analysis. In those cases, we use the command `append`, which really is the same as pasting more observations to the dataset. But since `merge` is a bit trickier we will focus on that command in this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different ways of merging datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `merge` command we can do three (or really, two) different types of merges. Easiest is the `1:1` merge. It means that we have the same observations in both datasets. For instance the same individuals, or the same countries; we just want to add more information about them. We then need a matching variable, a key, that shows the country's or the person's identity, so we can match the information in the two datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can also match `m:1`. It means that we have many observations in the dataset that is active in Stata, and want to add on data from a smaller number of observations, at a higher level. For instance, we might have data on persons in Europe, and want to add country-level information. Imagine that we have conducted a survey, and now want to see whether the answers are affected by whether the country of residence is an EU member or not. All persons in Sweden will have the same value - Sweden is a part of the EU. All persons in Norway will also have the same value - Norway is not a member of the EU. In our individual level dataset we can have thousands of observations, and still combine it with about 30 country-level observations (one for each country).\n",
    "\n",
    "The third type of merge is `1:m`. It is the exact same thing, but instead of starting with the individual level dataset, we start with the country level dataset, and add the individual level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combine two datasets with the same type of observations - `merge 1:1`\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the simplest type: when we have the same type of observations in both datasets, and want to add mode variables. Let's say we want to combine information about the level of democracy in a country with the level of corrption in the country. We can get information about democracy from [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world). The data is in Excel format, but we can just cut the relevant parts and paste into a Stata dataset. Then we get information about corruption from [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/cpi2018), and treat it the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have two datasets, `fh2017.dta` and `cpi2018.dta`. Below we load `fh2017.dta` and look at the first five rows in the dataset, with the help of the command `list`."

We want to match the level of democracy in Afghanistan with the level of corruption in Afghanistan. If we don't have a ID variable of this type it is impossible to do the merge. Generally, it is preferable if the ID is a number, and not a string (text) variable. It reduces the risk that the merge is hindered by spelling errors and so on. We can also match on serveral variables. For instance, when working with this type of data we often want to match on both country and year. Sweden 2008 should be matched to Sweden 2008, and so on.\n",
    "2. Make sure that the ID variable has the same name in both datasets.\n",

    "Note that all the variables from the democracy data - `fh_pr`, `fh_cl` and `fh_status` have the same value for all persons from each country. All persons from Afghanistan have the same value on the variable `fh_pr`, since the level of political rights is the same for everybody in Afghanistan. The variable only varies between countries, not within.\n",

    "## Remember\n",
    "1. There must be a matching variable, an ID variable, that has the same name in both datasets.\n",
    "2. The matching variables need to be of the same type. If you for instance have pasted data from Excel, make sure to check that both variables are numeric (if you have number codes), or that both variables are string variables (if they are names). You can see that by opening the data editor and looking at the colors of the numbers. If they are black they are numeric; if they are red they are text.\n",
    "3. If we want to add variables, the observations need to be the same in both datasets. We can for instance not combine survey data from different surveys, with different respondents.\n",
    "4. Remove unnecessary observations. If you have a main dataset and add a variable, remove any unnecessary observations that come with the new variable. They will only complicate future merges.\n",
    "5. Remember to drop the `_merge` variable when you are done matching, so that you can easily add more data later on.\n",
    "6. Be extra careful and double-check each step! When merges are unsuccessful, it is often because of some petty error, like wrong filenames or wrong address to the files and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The `merge` command is suitable when we want to add more variables. If we want to add observations, with information on the same variables, we need to use the `append` command. One such case might be when we want to combine surveys with identical questions, but carried out in 2018 and 2019. `append` then lets us combine the survey responses in one dataset."
