    "Stata is a program for data management and statistical analysis that is used frequently within the scientific community. The program has different parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The data files*, \"dataset,\" store the actual data we analyze, and have the file ending .dta. We can also load data in other formats, such as comma separated text files, .csv files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *do-files* are text files with code, that is, commands to the program. The files have the file ending .do and are stored separately. We can also type commands directly into Stata, or point and click in menus, but it is less transparent, and increases the risk of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good workflow is instead to create a do-file for each project. In the do-file, we:\n",
    "1. State the address to the folder where we keep our data files,\n",
    "2. Load the data files, do appropriate recodings and trim the data before the analyses that we are planning\n",
    "3. Run the analyses\n",
    "4. Produce tables and graphs that can be used in tet documents or presented on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data work is thus described in the do-file, and no changes are saved in the original dataset. This means, that when we close Stata and a window asks us if we want to save changes to the DATASET, we say no. This way, the work is easy to share with others, and we reduce the risk of errors that cannot be traced. \n",
    "\n",
    "The picture shows how it can look like when we work in Stata. The do-file is open in a separate window.\n",

    "We can then proceed with doing the recodings and the analyses we have planned. A good idea is to, in the do-file, place the data management stuff after opening the dataset, but before the analyses. This way, we can run the complete dofile from the top to the bottom everytime we work with the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is thus that when we work on the project, we do changes in the do-file which we save. The do-file is thus updated continously. But the actual dataset is only changed temporarily. Everytime we work with the project, the dataset is opened, changed in a lot of ways, depending on the requirements of the analyses. But when we are done with the analyses, we shut down the program **without saving the changes in the data** - only the changes in the do-file are saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons is that we often change variables. For instance, we might want to divide an age variable into two groups, those that are over and under 50 years. If we later decide that it would be better to divide the varible into over and under 40, we would have lost the original information if we had saved the changes to the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we instead work with do-files we will always have the original data, and we can simply change the commands in the do-file, so that the line is drawn at 40 instead of 50. This makes the workflow more transparent. Apart from being a benefit for the researcher doing the analysis and colleagues in the project, most reputable scientific journals nowadays require that those who want to publish in the journal submit their code, so that reviewers can inspect the analyses and the data management."
